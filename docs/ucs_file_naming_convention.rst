UNIVERSAL CATEGORY SYSTEM FILENAMING CONVENTION
=================================================

The UCS strongly encourages a special structure for filenames. If adhered to,
this structure in the filename allows automated scripts in various programs to
automatically parse out information from the filename into various fields of
Metadata for the end user.

It also encourages supplying a basic amount of information in the filename
itself. Information that can answer the following questions:

- What category and subcategory does this sound belong to?
- What is the sound?
- Who made the sound?
- What project or library was it made for?

The basic UCS filename structure requires at least four blocks of information,
and each block must be separated by an \_. The \_ may only be used to define
these blocks, and shouldnâ€™t be used elsewhere. 

The four basic blocks of the filename as defined and stuctured as follows:

::

  CatID_FXName_CreatorID_SourceID


``CatID`` 
  Abbreviated Category / SubCategory (as defined by UCS list)

``FXName``
  Brief Description or Title (under 25 character preferably)

``CreatorID``
  Sound Designer, Recordist or Vendor (or abbreviation for them)

``SourceID``
  Project, Show or Library name (or abbreviation representing it)

The ``CatID`` represents both the Category and SubCategory in abbreviated form
as defined in the Universal Category System list, initiated by Tim Nielsen and
Justin Druty.

the ``CatID`` is really at the heart of this entire system. It is the **only
requirement** to use the system, and it must not be altered from the list. We
ask that the case also be honored. It is what guarantees that anyone releasing
a wood door agrees that the short abbreviated form for this
``Category``/``SubCategory`` pair will be DOORWood.

This will allow any user of the system to know exactly where that sound
belongs. And using many of the scripts developed and being developed, most
common database programs can parse that out easily into the ``Category`` and
``SubCategory`` fields, and also in some cases build a ``CategoryFull`` field 
by looking up the ``CatID``, matching to the list, and then pasting the 
matched fields together with a hyphen. So DOORWood becomes DOORS-WOOD.

An example of a section of the UCS list is below:


================  ================  ===========  ===================
Category          SubCategory       CatID        CatShort

AIRCRAFT          ROCKET            AERORckt     AERO
================  ================  ===========  ===================


``CatShort`` is the abbreviation only for the ``Category``. At the moment it's 
not utilized as a metadata field, but is offered on the list for future use. It 
is NOT used as part of the filename, the full ``CatID`` must be used at the head
of the file.

``FXName`` is the next block of data in a UCS filename. Think of it as a Title.
The goal is to give a brief description of the sound; around 25 charactes is
usually ideal for the length of this field. This is not meant to repalce a more
elaborate 'Description' metadata field, but is meant so that at a glance, the
user will understand what the sound file is without having to listen to it.

``CreatorID`` shows you who recorded or designed the sound. A vendor would
place their name here... or you would put your name or initials. Most likely
you'll probably want to put an abbreviation here. This is entirely up to each
vendor or creator. UCS has a vendor list that allows a vendor to assign an
official abbreviation to be used in filenames. There will be more documentation
about defining this information in the Vendors folder.

At first glance, a user should be able to clearly tell that the sound came from
you, without having to even need access to the metadata. You could put your
entire name here, or the full name of your company. We only ask that you keep
this consistent on all of your products. And again if your name is long,
consider an abbreivated form if that makes sense to you.

``SourceID`` holds the name or abbreviated version fo the show, project or in
this case library.

Again as vendors and creators it's up to you how to best utilize this block of
text, but it should contain somwehow the name of your library that this sound
belongs to, or the show it was designed or recorded for. Again we'd encourage
some sort of abbreviation if your library name is very long.

OPTIONAL BLOCKS 
---------------

There are three optional blocks of information also available in the filename 
to satisfy specific instances. They are defined as ``UserCategory``, 
``VendorCategory``, and ``UserData``.

A breakdown of all blocks in a UCS full filename is as follows:

::

  CatID(-UserCategory)_(VendorCategory-)FXName_CreatorID_SourceID_UserData 


``UserCategory``
  An optional tail extension of the ``CatID`` block that can be used as a user
  defined category, microphone, perspective etc.

``VendorCategory``
  An optional head extension to the ``FXName`` block usable by vendors to
  define a library specific category. For example, the specific name of a gun,
  vehicle, location etc.

``UserData`` 
  A User defined space, often used for an ID or number for guaranteeing that
  the Filename is 100% unique... or storing things such as microphone type,
  location, perspective etc. This space is not currently mapped to user
  metadata but each user may choose to map this chunk of data to a database
  field depending on how they use it...

``UserCategory`` is an optional tail extension to the ``CatID``. It is
designated by simply placing a \- after the ``CatID`` and adding a user defined
term or abbreviation. Vendors should avoid using this area of the filename.

It is designed to allow users to create their own sort of sub-sub-category, a
third category of their choosing. The user might also choose to define this as
a set of abbreviations and a look up table. A common use might be INT and EXT
for INTERIOR and EXTERIOR.

``VendorCategory`` is an optional head extension to the ``FXName`` block. It is
defined as the first block of text immediately after the first \_, and up to
the very next \-. It is meant as an optional library specific category
definable by a vendor to organize a library internally. As many libraries
already have some logical category system in place, this block is meant as a
way to preserve that information for vendors when adapting a library to the UCS
standard.

``UserData`` is the last chunk of data in our filename sturcture, and it's
completely freeform. Each user or vendor will decide how to use this
information, as we do not assign it any standard metadata field. You could stor
here microphone and perspective, a unique file number, or any other information
you want to distribute to the end user.

Additional \_s used in this block, while discouraged, are not prohibited.

--------------------

Let's look at some examples:

::

  GUNAuto_Uzi 9mm Rapid Fire Close Up Short Bursts_TN_DORY

Is a valid filename because it contains all four required parts separated by 
\_s.

``CatID`` is defined as *GUNAuto*, and therefore ``Category`` is defined as
**GUNS** and the subcategory as **AUTOMATIC**. ``CategoryFull`` is defined as
**GUNS-AUTOMATIC** just by use of the simple ``CatID`` at the head of the
filename.

``FXName`` is defiend as "*Uzi 9mm Rapid File Close Up Short Bursts*".

``CreatorID`` is designated "*TN*", and via a lookup table, this information
can be easily parsed out as "Tim Nielsen".

``SourceID`` is designated as "*DORY*", and again, via a simple lookup table,
this information could be parsed out into Finding Dory, the name of the
project.

Notice how we are using abbreviations in the ``CatID``, ``CreatorID`` and
``SourceID`` blocks in an attempt to keep the fiename length manageable, but
still readable.

::

  GunAudio_UZI 9mm Rapid Fire Close Up Short Bursts_TN_DORY_WideStereoMKH8020


In this example, this filename adds the information "*WideStereoMKH8020*" into
the ``UserData`` block of the file. By default this won't be assigned to a
particular metadata field, but a user could easily script this to be placed in
a metadata field of their choosing. Again this ``UserData`` block can be used
to hold any additional information the creator deems important.

::
  
  GUNAuto-INT_UZI 9mm Rapid Fire Close Up Short Bursts_TN_DORY 

In this filename, the optional ``UserCategory`` of "*INT*" has bee defined by
the adding of **-INT** directly after the ``CatID``. Tools in database programs
could potentially take this term, and place into a metadata field called
``UserCategory``. This field could be defined for things like mic perspectives,
or perhaps a show-specific category for a project the user routinley uses. It
could optionally be defined as an abbreviation and a lookup table as well. 

::
 
  GUNAuto_UZI 9mm-Rapid Fire Close Up Short Bursts_TN_DORY 

In this filename, no ``UserCategory`` is defined, but by adding the text **UZI
9mm-** to the head of the ``FXName`` block, the ``VendorCategory`` has been
defined as "*UZI 9mm*".

While the entire block of data between the first and second \_ is technically
the FX name (*UZI 0mm-Rapid Fire Close Up Short Bursts*), the piece of
information between the first \_ and the first \- is now defined as a
``VendorCategory``. Programs could be easily scripted to break out this piece
of information and place in the ``VendorCategory`` field.

One final example shows a full UCS filename, will all the blocks filled:

::
  
  GUNAuto-EXT_UZI 9mm-Rapid Fire Close Up Short Bursts_TN_NONE_416-MKH8040-DualMono

This filename demonstrates the use of all assigned blocks in a UCS filename. In 
this case we have defined, simply by placement of \_s and -s in the filename, 
the following information:

``CatID`` 
  *GUNAuto* (GUNS-AUTOMATIC)

``UserCategory`` 
  *EXT* (in this case to designate by the user this is an EXTERIOR recording)

``FXName`` 
  *UZI 9mm-Rapid Fire Close Up Short Bursts*

``VendorCategory``
  *UZI 9mm*

``CreatorID`` 
  *TN* (which is a user defined abbreviation for Time Nielsen)

``SourceID``
  *None*
  
``UserData`` 
  *416-MKH8040DualMono*

CONCLUSION
----------

Just to reiterate, the **only requirement** fo the UCS system is the
designation of every file to one of the ``Category`` / ``SubCategroy`` pairs in
the list, and the associated ``CatID\_`` being placed at the head of the
filename. The rest of the filename structure is completely optional.

The immediate benefit of adhereing to this 'requirement' is that that purchaser
of your library will instantly know that the sound in question belongs to the
``Category``/``SubCategory`` pair GUNS-AUTOMATIC because *GUNAuto* is defined
in that list.

This rigid placement of *GUNAuto\_* at the head of the filename will also allow 
various scripts and parsing of that infomation back into metadata fields for the 
user. 

Also by placing the ``CatID`` at the beginning of the filename, all
GUNS-AUTOMATIC will now sort together in any list, or region list in any DAW,
on the folder level etc. 

There are numerous tools, scripts and helpers that exist that can help with
naming filenames according to this system, including ones that work for various
DAWs such as Pro Tools and Reaper. Please see the UTILITES folder on our Google
Shared Drive for mor infomration and to download the various tools as they are 
developed.
