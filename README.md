# Universal Category System - Community Resources

## What is this?

This repository contains documentation and some developer resources for the 
[Universal Category System][ucs], used for organizing sound effects libraries.

[ucs]: https://universalcategorysystem.com

## What's here?

Some items of interest are:

  - [JSON-formatted UCS Schedules](json/) for all the available languages.
  - The [tool](tools/ucsxls2json.py) used to make these JSON files from the
    original XLS file.
  - A [directory-creation tool](tools/ucsdirs.py) that can create a directory 
    tree of UCS categories and sub-categories in any of the supported
    languages, using the JSON schedule of your choice.

## Who maintains this?

This repository is maintained by [Jamie Hardt][jh]. I'm a user of UCS but I 
don't otherwise have any formal affiliation with Tim Nielsen, Justin Drury or 
the UCS creators or website.
